,projects,Projects | AidIQ.com,"<h1>Projects</h1><h2>Resource Mapping System - International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</h2><p>AidIQ developed the Resource Mapping System in Sahana Eden for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)&nbsp;to allow their National Societies to share information on their Inventory, Assets, Staff and Volunteers. Neighboring National Societies and the IFRC can quickly see what is available in the event of a major disaster. This information is blended with data from other Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Population Density, Rainfall and Topography to allow for a more informed planning of the response.The solution allowed agencies to share a common server, yet retain full control over their data and who can have access to it (i.e. a multi-tenancy system). The open source nature of the software was important because it meant there was no vendor lock-in and the software was easy to maintain. For this deployment the Sahana Team deployed using Amazon Web Services in the regional data center to guarantee low latency. This site is scheduled to go live in Q1 2012 and will then be extended to also use the Project module of Sahana Eden.You can view a demo video of the IFRC Resource Mapping System <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4EuwSTCUQ'>HERE</a>.</p><h2>Inter-Agency Information Sharing - HELIOS</h2><p>AidIQ were commissioned by the <a href='http://helios-foundation.org' target='_blank'>HELIOS foundation</a> to create a portal to allow NGOs working in the field to be able to share information on their In Stock &amp; On Order relief items. This allows them to use up surplus items, avoid goods expiring and avoid duplicate procurement. Future iterations could include sharing of information on Planned Procurements to allow bulk discounts &amp; shared freighting/importation costs. Data can be automatically uploaded from HELIOS instances or via manual data entry or uploading of spreadsheets. This work was done for the <a href='http://thecbha.org' target='_blank'>Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies</a> &amp; funded by DfID.</p><h2>DRR Project Portal - Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC)</h2><p><a href='http://www.drrprojects.net' target='blank'>The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Project Portal</a> collects information on all multi-country and national level DRR projects and initiatives in the Asia Pacific region implemented since 2005. By facilitating information sharing across the region, the Portal aims to advance the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) &nbsp;goals in building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters. This includes making disaster risk reduction a high priority on local and national levels. There are many priorities for action, such as knowing the risks, enhancing early warning systems to reduce vulnerabilities, and building a culture of safety and resilience for all people by strengthening networks and working with the media.&nbsp;This Sahana Eden-powered portal was deployed at the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.The DRR Project Portal:</p><ul><li>Helps effective planning, programming, cooperation, and collaboration of DRR projects and programs in the region by facilitating project analysis to identify gaps and overlaps.</li><li>Is essential for governments, organizations and donors involved in implementing and supporting DRR projects and program in the region.</li><li>Is a useful resource for academics, students and the media for obtaining an overview of DRR projects being implemented in the region.</li></ul><h2>Information Management Workshop - BPKEL</h2><p>AidIQ facilitated a series of workshops for BPKEL (Badan Pengelola Kawasan Ekosistem Leuser), the Aceh Conservation Agency in order to improve their information management processes to better comply with requirements of the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programme. After the first workshop, the current processes were documented and gaps were identified. A draft solutions document was then written and a second workshop was held to review and refine this document. BPKEL have agreed to share the final Information Management Standard Operating Procedures which were developed as a result of these workshops.<br><a href='sites/default/files/BPKEL-IM-SOP.pdf'> Download draft document</a>",
